    name: OptConnect
    url: https://optconnect.com/
    # company overview
    cases:
      - problem: OptConnect supplies hundreds of thousands of cellular internet modems to customers that deploy them to remote geographical locations. Contractually required to provide a certain amount of uptime, they must perform an expensive "truck roll" to service remote devices if they cannot be fixed remotely. They needed a solution to improve remote administration and uptime of devices on finicky high latency cellular networks.
