philosophy: |
  My goal is to select technologies that balance correctness, scalability, and simplicity — tools that make it easier to prove software does what it’s supposed to do and to maintain that correctness over time.

skills:
  - name: Languages & Frameworks
    summary: Haskell, Rust, Scala, Go, TypeScript — chosen for their strong type systems, concurrency models, and maintainability under growth.

  - name: Infrastructure & Operations
    summary: Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker, AWS, GCP — enable resilient, observable systems and predictable operations at scale.

  - name: Data & Storage
    summary: PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, S3 — simple, reliable primitives for data consistency and high-throughput workloads.

  - name: Practices & Tooling
    summary: CI/CD, property-based testing, end-to-end validation frameworks — reinforce engineering discipline and deployment confidence.
