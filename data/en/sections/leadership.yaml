philosophy: |
  I believe great engineering leadership combines technical understanding with empathy, clarity, and accountability. Projects fail when leaders lose touch with the work; success comes when leadership understands the system — both human and technical — deeply enough to guide it with purpose.

  I lead through principles, not ego. I believe in transparency, psychological safety, and the discipline of correctness. When leaders own mistakes publicly and communicate openly, teams learn faster and trust more — and that trust compounds into speed, quality, and innovation.
