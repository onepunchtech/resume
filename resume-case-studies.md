## Investment Bank (Anonymous)

### Problem

A team was struggling with correctness and maintainability of C/C++ libraries and services. They heard about other financial institutions adopting Rust and Haskell to deal with those problems. They needed a jump start to learn Haskell and how to apply it to their industry.

### Solution

- Multiday workshop
  - Wrote toy APIs/Services in Haskell
  - Authenticated to financial APIs, pulled financial data and performed various analysis 100% in haskell
  - Learned how to use Haskell's Foreign Function Interface to integrate with Rust and C/C++ to leverage existing and or faster open source libraries.
  - Specific knowledge of how to use Haskell to eliminate certain classes of bugs.
  - Haskell design patterns such as Monoids, Functors and Monads

### Value delivered

- Ability to make informed decisions about Haskell adoption
- Knowledge of how to adopt Haskell and make it work alongside existing code

# Opt Connect

## Problem 1

OptConnect supplies hundreds of thousands of cellular internet modems to customers that deploy them to remote geographical locations. Contractually required to provide a certain amount of uptime, they must perform an expensive "truck roll" to service remote devices if they cannot be fixed remotely. They needed a solution to improve remote administration and uptime of devices on finicky high latency cellular networks.

### Solution

- Implement a site reliability engineering team
  - Teach and mentor team in site reliability engineering practices
  - Engineer Kubernetes Solution
  - Teach across the organization how other teams could target Kubernetes
  - Implement zero downtime deployments
  - Engineer analytics system to quickly determine firmware issues of devices.

### Value delivered

- Reduced "truck rolls"
- Improved customer relations by finding and resolving problems before customer
- Modern deployment strategies enable standardization when hiring devops engineers
- Uptime of core services 99.99%
- Improved success rate of remote flashes in unstable conditions 90%

## Problem 2

2. OptConnect was growing so fast their system for flashing devices was not keeping up. The devices came flashed with old firmware from China, and needed to be updated before being shipped to the customers. Flashing tens of devices at the same time would overwhelm the system and flashing over hard-wire is believed to be impossible.

### Solution

- Engineered and architected new firmware and flashing system
  - Designed solution to enable hard-wire flashing for network engineer to implement
  - Rewrote firmware itself to improve wireless flashing success rate

### Value delivered

- Fulfillment can keep up with sales, revenue can be counted on time and sales can be paid commissions on time.
- Reduced firmware size by 85%
- Faster startup time 12x
- 100% elimination of failed flashes
- Flashing throughput improved 1000%

# Omnivore

## Problem 1

Restaurants are locked into their point of sales devices. Updating menus across chains is expensive, and each point of sales vendor has their unique way of managing menus.

### Solution

- Engineer and architected menu syncing system
  - Design interface around POS devices to allow two-way syncing
  - Engineer solution to perform two-way syncing that automatically handled merge conflicts

### Value delivered

- Simplified menu design for restaurants
- Saved restaurants millions in menu management costs
- Liberated restaurants from point of sales device tyranny

## Problem 2

Point of sales devices do not integrate with all the food delivery services e.g. UberEats, Doordash, Grubhub.

### Solution

2. Implemented integrations with food delivery services
   - Designed and architected interface that captured all food delivery service functionality
   - Implemented integrations with UberEats, Doordash and grubhub.

### Value delivered

- Restaurants could remove the dozens of phones and tables they used to integrate ad-hoc with delivery services
- Improved customer acquisition

# BigSquid

## Problem

Companies have data but don't know how to leverage it. Data scientists are expensive, and data scientists don't have time or resources to train models with a wide range of hyperparameters. Even when companies do manage to train models it is difficult to deploy them to the field to get live predictions. Additionally, the cost of compute and storage scales exponentially when training multiple models.

## Solution

- Automate a data scientist
  - Engineer a data pipeline to work with common data sources like BI platforms, databases and excel
  - Engineer data storage to enable fast efficient querying as well as data manipulation
  - Engineer cheaper method of gathering expensive metrics for massive data sets that do not fit in memory
  - Encode the expertise of multiple data scientists into a model training engine
  - Engineer UI to allow user to select data source and run "what if" predictions

## Value delivered

- Real time updates to the customer as data changed
- Infrastructure cost scaled linearly with customer size
- Constant compute cost per customer (for most models and metrics) regardless of data size
- Analytics and predictions on any dataset
- Automatic detection of problems with dataset and suggested improvements to find better data

# O.C. Tanner

## Problem

O.C. Tanner provides a SASS platform for employers to show appreciation to employees. The platform is branded and has many customizations tailor made to a customer. The time to implement the product for a new customer took months and needed many engineering man hours.
